# TODO - sti
- Update requirements and setup.py
- Update tests
- Add more test
- Replace linear model with neural network model
- Consinder boosting training data by added copied with randomly rotated co-ordinate systems
- Move data to separate folder
- Divert output from training to separate folder
- Enhance loading of models from disk
- Add low and high inclination limits 
- Translate position in input for improved predictions when start is not at origo
- Handle input that is outside of trained range by scaling position and dog leg limits
- Wrap core function with user oriented Python API
- Improve logging
- Move model fitting over to separate repo to reduce dependencies?
- Obtain a shitload of training data
- Fit a neural network
- Separate project: Make a RRT-star overlap. Consider using only a fitted model!
- Wrap the RRT-star model in a FastAPI package
