# TODO - sti
- Update requirements and setup.py
- Update tests
- Add more test
- Add low and high inclination limits 
- Move linear model and data to separate folder
- Refactor, move create training data to separate file
- Move model fitting over to separate repo to reduce dependencies
- Improve linear_model code. Or just wait until enough data is available to build a deep nn?
- Divert output from training to separate folder
- Enhance loading of linear model from disk
- Translate position in input for improved predictions when start is not at origo
- Handle input that is outside of trained range by scaling position and dog leg limits
- Wrap core function with user oriented Python API
- Improve logging
- Reset global search when misfit > threshold
- Obtain a shitload of training data
- Fit a neural network
- Separate project: Make a RRT-star overlap. Consider using only the linear model!
- Wrap the RRT-star model in a FastAPI package
