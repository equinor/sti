# TODO - sti
- Update requirements and setup.py
- Add more test
- Replace linear model with neural network model
- Enhance loading of models from disk
- Handle input that is outside of trained range by scaling position and dog leg limits
- Wrap core function with user oriented Python API
- Improve logging
- Move model fitting over to separate repo to reduce dependencies?
- Separate project: Make a RRT-star overlap. Consider using only a fitted model!
- Wrap the RRT-star model in a FastAPI package
